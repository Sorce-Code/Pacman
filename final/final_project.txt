Description of Game:
We are recreating the game PacMan. We will use the SD card to hold our
background graphic, as well as our audio. The LCD will display a simplified
version of pacman. We will incorporate a nunchuk as a way to control pacman.
The ghosts will move randomly. The nunchuk will also act as out user input.
At the beginning of the game, the pacman intro music is played (our audio).
